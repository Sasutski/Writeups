# Around the World
## Disclaimer: I did not solve this challenge in time, and required quite a substantial amount of hints to finish it.

Category: **OSINT**  
Difficulty: **Hard (Tedious)**

Before we start, we have a message from the challenge setter on how I solved this challenge:

I cannot agree enough.  
Not only did this challenge take me through the 10 stages of hell, it might have also taken me through the 5 stages of grief. Nonetheless, let's get into how we solved it after countless hours.

## Stage 1: Limbo
At the start of the challenge, we are given the file ```diary.txt``` along with the caption: 
> I had a dream, a dream of travelling around the world. I’ve spent years planning to ensure that when I embark on my trip, it’s going to be perfect. I’ll be starting on my trip in a few more months. I’m so excited!

At first glance, we aren't given many clues on what we are supposed to find, nor even how the flag would be formed.  
Since no coordinates were mentioned, I ruled out a simple Google image search, as most setters would tell us how many decimal places the flag would require.
